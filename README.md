# Module 2 Weekly Challenge - Professional Coding Portfolio

## Description

A well-put together portfolio showcasing one's coding skills is an enormous asset for a job search in the web development field. Not only does a good portfolio give potential employers an insight into your abilities and thought process, but having several web applications deployed is often the baseline requirement for a company to give you an interview. As such, I put together a portfolio showcasing some of the web development projects I've worked on thus far, and set it up such that I can add new projects or replace old ones easily in the future. I've also included a short About Me section to introduce myself, and contact information.
